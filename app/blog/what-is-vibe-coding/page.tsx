            Three months ago, I finished a complete admin dashboard in 45 minutes. Authentication, user management, 
            charts, export functions—everything. A year ago, that would have taken me a full week.

            <h2>What Vibe Coding Actually Is</h2>
            <p>
              Vibe coding is how developers build software in 2025. You describe what you want in natural language. 
              AI generates working code. You review and refine it. Then ship it.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not no-code. No-code locks you into templates and platforms. Vibe coding produces real, 
              custom code—TypeScript, React, Python, whatever you need—that you own and control. It's just created 
              exponentially faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              I write prompts. AI writes code. I review for logic errors and edge cases. We iterate instantly. 
              Then we deploy production-ready software.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="blog-section">
            <h2>The First Time I Saw It Work</h2>
            <p>
              Last year, a client needed Stripe integration with subscription management. I'd done it before—it takes 
              about two days if you're careful. Reading docs, handling webhooks, testing edge cases, error recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              I described the requirements to Claude: "Integrate Stripe checkout with monthly and annual subscription 
              plans, handle webhooks for successful payments and cancellations, manage subscription status in the database."
            </p>
            <p>
              Two hours later, it was done. Complete implementation. Webhook handlers. Database updates. Error handling. 
              I reviewed the code, tested it, pushed to production. The client was thrilled.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's when it clicked. This wasn't a productivity boost. This was a complete shift in how software gets built.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="blog-section">
            <h2>How It Actually Works</h2>
            <p>
              Here's my daily workflow now:
            </p>

            <div className="blog-workflow">
              <div className="workflow-step">
                <h3>1. Describe Intent Clearly</h3>
                <p>
                  Be specific about requirements. Not implementation. "Build user authentication with email verification 
                  and password reset" tells the AI what to accomplish, not how to code it.
                </p>
                <div className="workflow-example">
                  <strong>Good prompt:</strong> "Create an admin dashboard with user table, search/filter, export to CSV, and role management"
                  <br /><br />
                  <strong>Bad prompt:</strong> "Make a dashboard" (too vague)
                  <br /><br />
                  <strong>Bad prompt:</strong> "Use React Table library with custom hooks to render..." (too prescriptive)
                </div>
              </div>

              <div className="workflow-step">
                <h3>2. AI Generates Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                  The AI handles boilerplate, error handling, edge cases, security best practices. It doesn't get tired. 
                  It doesn't cut corners at 5 PM on Friday.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It also makes mistakes. That's where you come in.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="workflow-step">
                <h3>3. Human Review and Refinement</h3>
                <p>
                  This is the critical step most people skip. I read every line of generated code. I check:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Does this handle the edge case where users have special characters in emails?</li>
                  <li>What happens if the API times out?</li>
                  <li>Is this database query optimized for 10,000+ records?</li>
                  <li>Does this create a security vulnerability?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  When I find issues, I tell the AI: "Add rate limiting to prevent abuse" or "Optimize this query with 
                  pagination." It adjusts instantly.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="workflow-step">
                <h3>4. Ship Production Code</h3>
                <p>
                  No prototypes. No "we'll clean this up later." Production-ready code from day one. Because AI doesn't 
                  accumulate technical debt the way exhausted humans do.
                </p>

            <h2>What Makes a Good Vibe Coder</h2>
            <p>
              Here's what separates good vibe coders from people just copy-pasting AI output:
            </p>

            <div className="blog-skills">
              <div className="skill-card">
                <h3>Domain Knowledge</h3>
                <p>
                  You need to know what good software looks like. What makes a secure authentication flow? When should 
                  you use a database transaction? How do you handle race conditions?
                </p>
                <p>
                  AI can implement these things. But you need to know when to ask for them.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="skill-card">
                <h3>Clear Communication</h3>
                <p>
                  Vague prompts get vague code. "Build a login" gives you basic auth. "Build JWT-based authentication 
                  with email verification, password reset, session management, and rate limiting" gives you production-ready auth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The clearer you communicate, the better the code.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="skill-card">
                <h3>Code Literacy</h3>
                <p>
                  You must read and understand the generated code. If you can't spot bugs, security issues, or 
                  performance problems, vibe coding is dangerous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is why vibe coding doesn't replace developers. It makes good developers unstoppable.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="skill-card">
                <h3>System Thinking</h3>
                <p>
                  How do components interact? What are the dependencies? What breaks if this service goes down? What's 
                  the data flow?
                </p>
                <p>
                  AI generates individual pieces. You architect the whole system.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="skill-card">
                <h3>Quality Judgment</h3>
                <p>
                  When is AI output good enough? When does it need refinement? When should you scrap it and try a 
                  different approach?
                </p>
                <p>
                  This comes from experience. Not from typing faster.

            <h2>Common Mistakes I See</h2>
            
            <div className="mistake-card">
              <h3>Using AI output without review</h3>
              <p>
                I've seen developers ship AI-generated code they don't understand. It breaks in production. They can't 
                fix it. They blame AI.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Read every line. Understand what it does. Test edge cases. If you don't understand 
                it, ask AI to explain or rewrite it more clearly.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mistake-card">
              <h3>Over-specifying implementation</h3>
              <p>
                "Use React useState for the counter, create a handleClick function, map over the array with .map()..." 
                You're micromanaging. Let AI handle implementation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Describe what you want, not how to code it. Focus on requirements and constraints.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="mistake-card">
              <h3>Treating it like Google</h3>
              <p>
                Vibe coding isn't about asking "How do I implement X?" and copy-pasting answers. It's about describing 
                complete features and getting working implementations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Think in features, not functions. "Build complete email verification" not "How do 
                I send an email in Node.js?"
              </p>
            </div>
          </section>

          <section className="blog-section">
            <h2>Why This Changes Everything</h2>
            <p>
              I'm 32. I've been coding since I was 14. I'm out-building developers with 20+ years of experience right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not because I'm better. Because I adapted faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditional coding: Think → Code → Debug → Test → Refactor (hours to days per feature)
            </p>
            <p>
              Vibe coding: Think → Describe → Review → Ship (minutes to hours per feature)
            </p>
            <p>
              The bottleneck shifted from typing speed to clarity of thought. From syntax mastery to system design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Developers who can clearly articulate requirements and review code effectively are outpacing those who 
              still write everything line by line.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="blog-section">
            <h2>The Hard Truth</h2>
            <p>
              By 2026, vibe coding will be standard. Maybe sooner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Developers resisting this are like graphic designers who refused to learn Photoshop in 2000. Technically 
              skilled but economically obsolete. Companies won't pay traditional rates for work that vibe coders do 
              10x faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't doom and gloom. It's reality. Adapt or get left behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news? If you're reading this, you're early. Most developers haven't figured this out yet. You 
              have time to build the skills that matter: clear communication, code review, system architecture, quality judgment.

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
              Here's how I'd start if I were learning vibe coding today:
            </p>
            <ol className="blog-ordered-list">
              <li>Pick a small feature you've built before. Authentication, CRUD operations, API integration—something familiar.</li>
              <li>Describe it to Claude or GPT-4 in natural language. Be specific about requirements.</li>
              <li>Review the generated code line by line. Understand what it does.</li>
              <li>Test it. Find edge cases. Ask AI to handle them.</li>
              <li>Compare the time to your previous implementation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Start small. Build confidence. Scale up to bigger features.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within weeks, you'll be shipping faster than you ever have. Within months, you'll wonder how you ever 
              coded any other way.

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              Vibe coding isn't magic. It's a methodology. AI generates. Humans architect and review. Together, we 
              build software faster than either could alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the future. The only question is whether you'll be early or late.
