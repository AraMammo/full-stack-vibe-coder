WHAT TO BUILD

1. Enhanced FAQ Page (app/faq/page.tsx)

Current state: FAQ exists but needs "What is vibe coding?" added as FIRST question

New first question with this exact structure:

Question: "What is vibe coding?"

Answer content (use this structure, refine the copy):

Paragraph 1: Define it clearly
"Vibe coding is how modern developers build software in 2025. You describe what you want in natural language. AI generates working code. You review and refine it. Then ship it."

Paragraph 2: Distinguish from no-code
"This is not no-code. No-code tools lock you into templates. Vibe coding produces real, custom code—TypeScript, React, Python, whatever you need—just exponentially faster."

Section: How it works (bullet list)
- Describe the intent: "Build user authentication with email verification"
- AI generates complete implementation with security and error handling
- Human reviews logic and edge cases
- Iterate instantly: "Make password requirements stricter" → done in seconds
- Ship production code, not prototypes

Section: Why this matters
"I'm out-coding 20-year veterans right now. Not because I'm smarter. Because I'm using 2025 tools. A senior dev writing line-by-line is being outpaced by someone who clearly articulates requirements and uses AI to build."

Section: Speed comparison
Traditional: Think → Code → Debug → Test → Refactor (hours to days per feature)
Vibe coding: Think → Describe → Review → Ship (minutes to hours per feature)

Section: What makes a good vibe coder (bullet list)
- Domain knowledge: Understanding what good software looks like
- Clear communication: Vague prompts get vague code
- Code literacy: Read and understand generated code to catch errors
- System thinking: How components interact and depend on each other
- Quality judgment: Know when AI output needs human refinement

Final punch: "Everyone will code this way by 2026. Developers still writing boilerplate by hand will be like designers who refused to learn Photoshop in 2000. Technically skilled but economically obsolete."

Ensure FAQ page:
- Dark theme matching brand
- Accordion interaction (one question open at a time)
- First question open by default
- Keyboard accessible
- Mobile responsive
- CTA at bottom: "Record Your Idea" button linking to /upload

2. Dedicated Landing Page (app/what-is-vibe-coding/page.tsx)

Build comprehensive standalone page optimized for SEO:

Page structure:

HERO SECTION:
- H1: "What is Vibe Coding?"
- Subtitle: "The future of software development is here. This is how everyone will code by 2026."
- Two-column layout (desktop): 
  - Left: Text content
  - Right: Visual diagram or code example showing prompt → AI → code flow
- CTA: "See Vibe Coding in Action" → link to /upload

SECTION: The Definition
- Clear, authoritative explanation (3-4 paragraphs)
- Use the FAQ answer as foundation but expand
- Add concrete example: Show a prompt and the resulting code snippet
- Embed comparison table (traditional vs vibe coding)

SECTION: How Vibe Coding Works (Step-by-step with visuals)
Step 1: Describe Intent
- Example prompt in code block
- Visual indicator (icon or number)

Step 2: AI Generates Code  
- Show snippet of generated code
- Annotate what AI handled automatically

Step 3: Human Review
- Show refinement prompt
- Highlight what human judgment adds

Step 4: Ship Production Code
- Final code block
- Metrics: "4 hours of work → 20 minutes"

SECTION: Vibe Coding vs Traditional Coding
Comparison table with these rows:
- Speed: 1x baseline vs 10x faster
- Primary skill: Syntax mastery vs System thinking  
- Bottleneck: Typing speed vs Idea clarity
- Learning curve: Years vs Weeks
- Cost: $100-200/hr vs $50-100/hr
- Code quality: Variable (human fatigue) vs Consistent (AI + review)

SECTION: Real Examples
Three concrete examples (card layout):

Card 1: Authentication System
Traditional: 4 hours (setup, validation, error handling, security)
Vibe coding: 15 minutes
Prompt shown: "Build JWT-based auth with email verification and password reset"

Card 2: Admin Dashboard  
Traditional: 8 hours (components, state, responsive design)
Vibe coding: 45 minutes  
Prompt shown: "Create admin dashboard with user table, charts, filters, and export"

Card 3: Payment Integration
Traditional: 2 days (API docs, testing, edge cases)
Vibe coding: 2 hours
Prompt shown: "Integrate Stripe checkout with subscription management and webhooks"

SECTION: Common Misconceptions
Address these as expandable cards or FAQ-style:

"It's just ChatGPT" → No. It's AI + architecture knowledge + code review + testing
"The code must be terrible" → It's production-tested and human-reviewed  
"This will replace developers" → It makes good developers unstoppable
"Real developers don't need this" → Real developers are already using it

SECTION: Who Uses Vibe Coding
- Solo developers shipping products 10x faster
- Agencies reducing costs while improving quality
- Startups building MVPs in weeks instead of months
- Technical founders who understand code but don't want to write boilerplate

SECTION: The Future is Now
"By 2026, vibe coding will be standard. The developers resisting this shift are like graphic designers who refused to learn Photoshop in 2000. Technically skilled but economically obsolete."

"The question isn't whether to adopt vibe coding. It's whether you'll be early or late."

FINAL CTA:
- Large section with dark background
- "Experience Vibe Coding For Your Project"
- "Record your idea. Get a proposal in 6 hours."
- Button: "Start a Project" → /upload

SEO REQUIREMENTS:

Metadata (add to page.tsx):
```typescript
export const metadata = {

}
```

Add FAQ Schema markup (JSON-LD in head):
```typescript
const faqSchema = {
