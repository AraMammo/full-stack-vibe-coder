# Client Access Setup Guide - FullStack Vibe Coder

*Last Updated: November 2025*

This guide helps our clients quickly provide the technical access needed to start their automation projects. We've made this as simple as possible - most setups take under 10 minutes.

---

## Quick Overview

For most projects, we need access to:
1. **Airtable** - Your database/workflow system
2. **Google Drive** - Document storage
3. **Other Tools** - Any specialized platforms you use

We'll use a project-specific email (like `yourproject@fullstackvibecoder.com`) for all access. This keeps things secure and makes cleanup easy when the project ends.

## Security Best Practices

### What We Do
- ✅ Use project-specific emails
- ✅ Store credentials in encrypted vaults
- ✅ Enable 2FA where possible
- ✅ Document all access
- ✅ Revoke access post-project

### What We Never Do
- ❌ Ask for your personal passwords
- ❌ Request unnecessary admin access
- ❌ Share credentials between projects
- ❌ Keep access after contract ends

---

## Sending Credentials Securely

### Option 1: During Screen Share
- Simplest for non-technical users
- We'll guide you through each step
- Takes 15-20 minutes total

### Option 2: Encrypted Message
We'll send you a secure link where you can paste credentials. The link:
- Self-destructs after viewing
- Is encrypted end-to-end
- Leaves an audit trail

### Option 3: Password Manager
If your team uses 1Password, LastPass, etc:
- Create a shared vault
- Add credentials there
- Share with project email
- Revoke when complete

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I can't add external emails"
Your IT team may have restrictions. Either:
1. Ask IT to whitelist `@fullstackvibecoder.com`
2. Create a service account within your system
3. We'll work with your security requirements

### "I don't see these options"
You might not have admin access. You'll need to:
1. Contact your workspace admin
2. Or schedule a call where they can join
3. We're happy to work with your team

### "Our security team has questions"
Perfect! We welcome security reviews. We can provide:
- Security practices documentation
- Insurance certificates
- Data handling agreements
- References from similar projects

**Q: Why do you need Creator/Editor access in Airtable?**
A: To set up webhooks and automations. We can work with less access but it limits functionality.

A: Absolutely! We encourage it. We'll also remind you when the project ends.

**Q: What if we use different tools?**
A: This guide covers 80% of cases. We'll provide specific instructions for your unique tools.

**Q: Is the project email monitored 24/7?**
A: It forwards to our main system, so we'll see any notifications immediately during business hours.
